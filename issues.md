## Open / Backlog

### P2 — Medium Priority

| Area | Issue | Location / Context | Notes |
|------|-------|--------------------|-------|
| Scale | Redis-backed queue | *New design needed* | DB queue works for single-region; Redis for multi-worker scale out |
| Security | CORS wildcard credentials | `main.py` | Wildcard origins now disable credentials; set explicit `CORS_ORIGINS` in prod |
